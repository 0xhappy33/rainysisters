					<!-- Gioi thieu ve sach -->

						<p>Ray Dalio wasn‚Äôt always a billionaire. In fact, he punched his boss in the face, nearly went broke multiple times, and ran a fledgling business from a two-bedroom apartment in New York.</p>
						<p>What he was doing wasn‚Äôt working. But unlike most people, when the chips were down, Ray didn‚Äôt blame the world. Rather, he confronted reality and vowed to change.</p>
						<p>Below are three strategies, pulled from an interview he gave on 
							<a href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/10/ray-dalio/" data-href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/10/ray-dalio/" target="_blank">Farnam Street‚Äôs podcast The Knowledge Project</a>
